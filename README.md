# sports_analytics

## Covers the general codebase for all things sports.

The goal of this repo is to have a variety of working code and models around the following areas:

1.) Fantasy football (Leagues and DFS) + side work to present interesting findings to drive league engagement (i.e. smack talk)  
2.) College basketball (Conference tournaments and March Madness)  

This is a sandbox repository to work on a variety of sports-related code, typically in Python for now.
